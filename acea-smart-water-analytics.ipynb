It holds 69 km³ of water, is 31 metres at its deepest point and, covers an area of 5km². The task is to predict the Lake Level and Flow Rate for the next day from historical Rainfall, Temperature, Lake Level and Flow Rate data. \n\n## Our Understanding of the Lake Mechanics\nThe daily change in the lake water volume is the sum of the inflows less the sum of the outflows which for this model we assume:\n1. The inflow is just from the rain runoff in the catchment area.   \n2. The outflows are just evaporation and river outflows. \n\nThis ignores losses due to seepage into the ground (likely to be small) or inflows from underground reserves.\n\n### Rainfall\nWe are provided with the 24hr rainfall data for the catchment area. Not all this rainfall will end up \nin the dam, i.e.,some will seep into the ground, evaporate or be lost to other rivers/catchments. \nIt is likely that it will take hours or days for the rainfall to arrive at the Lake and the inflow \nmay be spread over several days.  We explore this below by looking at cross correlations between the \ndaily lake level changes and the rainfall. We see correlations at days 0, -1, -2, and -3, with the \npeak correlation at day -1, i.e., the average lag between the rain falling and the inflow is 1 day.  \nSince these Rainfall measurements are from adjacent areas it is likely they are highly correlated\nand we explore this below. \n\n### Evaporation\nThe key factors affecting evaporation are\n* Temperature: As the temperature increases, the rate of evaporation also increases. \n* Surface area: As the surface area increases, the rate of evaporation increases. \n* Humidity: The rate of evaporation decreases with an increase in humidity. \n* Wind speed: Increase in wind speed results in increased evaporation. \n\nThe only data we are provided is the Temperature.  As the surface areas does not vary greatly on a daily basis this can safely be ignored. The importance of humidity and/or wind speed is unknown and may need to be investigated but is ignored in the following models.\n\n### River Outflow\nWhile we are given this it is considered to be an target (or output) variable. This means we can't use \"tomorrows\" river outflow when predicting \"tomorrows\" Lake Level. Instead we need to predict the River Outflow and use that. In the modeling below we find that simply using today's outflow in the model provides a prediction that is very close to using the actual measured outflow from \"tomorrow\". \n\nIn many damns the outflow is manually controlled to manage the lake levels so that:\n1. Below a specific level the outflow is a constant low amount, typically designed to maintain the health of the associated downstream water ecosystem.\n2. Above a specific level the outflow increases and to maintain some optimal Lake Level range. \n\nThis manual control may have significant impact on modeling the River Outflow. Specifically the relationship between Lake Level and River Outflow may inherently be nonlinear and, the relationship may suddenly and unpredictably change if the policy on how outflow is managed is changed. We see evidence for both in the analysis below.\n\n### Lake Level\nWe assume the change in Lake Level is proportional to the change in lake volume (i.e., inflows - outflows). Since the lake has an irregular volumetric profile the change in level is not exactly proportional to volume, and may be dependant on the Lake Level, but this is a reasonable approximation for daily changes.\n\nThis means that input variables (i.e., Rainfall, Temperature) will be correlated with Lake Level Changes (though the change in volume) rather than with the Lake Level. This is because the Lake Level is the accumulation of all the prior Lake Level Changes.  This is clearly seen below in the correlation between Rainfall and Lake Level and Lake Level Changes and with autocorrelation plots.  \n\n\n## Summary\nBased on this understanding of the physical model, our hypothesis is the daily Lake Levels Changes are driven by the inflow of rain from the last few days less the outflows from evaporation and the flow rate and, the Lake Levels are calculated by adding this change to the current level. We use these insights into the physical model to drive the Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Modeling below."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport missingno as msno\nimport sys\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import gridspec\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (16, 4)\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\npd.options.display.float_format = '{:.2f}'.format\n\nfrom termcolor import colored","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def missing(df):\n    return df.isnull().sum()/len(df)*100\n    \ndef date_features(df):\n    df['year'] =  df.index.year\n    df['month'] =  df.index.month\n    df['dayofyear'] =  df.index.dayofyear\n    df['dayofweek'] =  df.index.dayofweek\n\n    df['weekofyear'] =  df.index.weekofyear","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dfs = dict()\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        if filename.endswith('.csv'):\n            name = filename[:-4]\n            dfs[name] = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(dirname, filename), parse_dates=['Date'], dayfirst=True)\n            \n\nprint(\"Names of objects and shape of datasets:\")\nfor key in dfs:\n    print(f\"{key}, {dfs[key].shape}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dfs_time = pd.DataFrame(dfs.keys(), columns=['name'])\ndfs_time['first_date'] = [dfs[key]['Date'].min() for key in dfs]\ndfs_time['last_date'] = [dfs[key]['Date'].max() for key in dfs]\ndfs_time['duration'] = (dfs_time['last_date'] - dfs_time['first_date']).apply(lambda x: x.days)+1\ndfs_time['unique_days'] = [dfs[key]['Date'].nunique() for key in dfs]\ndfs_time['missing_days'] = dfs_time['duration']-dfs_time['unique_days']\ndfs_time['null_rows'] = [dfs[key].isnull().all(axis='columns').sum() for key in dfs]\ndfs_time['null_date'] = [dfs[key]['Date'].isnull().sum() for key in dfs]\ndfs_time['missing_data'] = [dfs[key].isnull().sum().sum() for key in dfs]\n\ndfs_time.sort_values(\"missing_data\")[['name', 'first_date', 'last_date', 'missing_days', 'null_rows', 'null_date', 'missing_data']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dfs['Water_Spring_Madonna_di_Canneto'].dropna(subset=['Date'], inplace=True)\nfor key in dfs:\n    dfs[key].set_index('Date', drop=True, inplace=True, verify_integrity=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis\nThe data includes: \n* Rainfall for 5 catchment areas\n* Temperature for Le Croci, which is close to the lake\n* Lake Level and output Flow Rate which are the targets\n\n### Missing Data\nThe visualizations below show there is daily data from 2002-06-03 to 2020-06-30, however the 2002 and 2003 data is missing all Rainfall data.
